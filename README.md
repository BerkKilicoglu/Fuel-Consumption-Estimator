Users can create many vehicle options, and estimate the amount of fuel consumption for these vehicles to artificial intelligence via the application. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to estimate the amount of fuel consumption of vehicles.

All vehicle options are compatible with real life. A public data set was used for the machine learning model. [Please click](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) for the data set.
